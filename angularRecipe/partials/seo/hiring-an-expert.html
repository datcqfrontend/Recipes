                    <p>It is very difficult to choose a correct SEO expert or SEO company. However the following guidelines can help you in this activity:</p>

                    <ul>

                      <li>Post your queries in SEO Forums to get feedback from the community.</li>
                      <li>Check other sites rank which they already have optimized.</li>
                      <li>Do not go for SEO companies doing automated submission.</li>
                      <li>Do not go for SEO companies doing Black Hat tricks.</li>
                      <li>Do not look for cheap SEO. But take care, high price also does not guarantee high quality.</li>
                      <li>Take guarantee if possible for a particular rank and any particular search engine.</li>
                      <li>User SEO Expert or Company name in Google to find more information about them.</li>
                      <li>Do not go just because of their fancy site and availability of good articles on their site.</li>
                      <li>Do not get fascinated by the testimonials available on their sites.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We can not list out all the factors here because there may be different situations and different views. You should be smart enough to think what's bad and what's good.</p>
